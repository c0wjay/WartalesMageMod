Thanks to new units and skills, enemy troops will definitely give you a run for your money. You might have to enter into battles more carefully and even rework the composition of your team. Your tactics and strategies will have an even more decisive impact.<br/><br/>You can now change the difficulty level at any time in the Options menu. If you're having a hard time, feel free to retreat and decrease the difficulty until you get the hang of things.<br/><br/>For more details, check out the latest patch notes listing all the difficulty-related changes.</desc>

            <desc>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern.jpg"/&gt;The Tavern is an establishment managed by the troop, which can generate revenue during each Shift. To operate successfully, a Tavern requires staff, equipment and an extensive menu.<br/><br/>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_prestige.jpg"/&gt;The Tavern's reputation is measured by Prestige &lt;img src="icon/TavernPrestige"/&gt;. Using Prestige, you can unlock equipment and expand the Tavern. The more numerous, varied and satisfied your patrons are, the more Prestige &lt;img src="icon/TavernPrestige"/&gt; you will earn.<br/><br/>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_satisfaction.jpg"/&gt;The main ways to attract patrons and encourage them to spend money are Comfort &lt;img src="icon/TavernComfort"/&gt;, Security &lt;img src="icon/TavernSecurity"/&gt; and Satisfaction &lt;img src="icon/Happiness"/&gt;, which are calculated after each Shift.</desc>

            <desc>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_brewing.jpg"/&gt;Each barrel with a Brewer assigned to it can produce alcohol. Production is calculated during each Shift, and costs resources. Production depends on the Brewer's level, the type of alcohol and the degree of ageing &lt;img src="icon/QualityStar"/&gt;.<br/><br/>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_aging.jpg"/&gt;When a barrel is put in reserve and a Brewer is assigned to it, its degree of ageing &lt;img src="icon/QualityStar"/&gt; will gradually increase, thereby increasing its value. Ageing alcohol does not cost resources.<br/><br/>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_infiltration.jpg"/&gt;To acquire new recipes, you can explore the Compendium – or, if your Prestige is high enough, steal secret recipes from rival Taverns.</desc>

These roles can be filled by your Companions, or by civilians recruited specifically for the Tavern.<br/><br/>When the troop is away from the Tavern, transferring a Companion does not take effect until after the next Shift. Civilians are available immediately, but cannot learn a new profession or be transferred to the troop. When a civilian is fired, they receive a small bonus.<br/><br/>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_employee.jpg"/&gt; Employee wages depend on their role, the Tavern's Prestige &lt;img src="icon/TavernPrestige"/&gt; and their Profession level. Working in the Tavern grants Profession experience.</desc>

            <desc>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_coins.jpg"/&gt; Taverns use a special currency: Copper Coins &lt;img src="icon/TavernSilver"/&gt;. They can be exchanged for Krowns &lt;img src="icon/Gold"/&gt;, but the exchange rate will decline with each additional withdrawal. The rate rises slightly after each Shift.<br/><br/>Krowns &lt;img src="icon/Gold"/&gt; can only be used to replenish the Tavern's funds when its balance is negative. The exchange rate is then set at 1 &lt;img src="icon/TavernSilver"/&gt; for 1 &lt;img src="icon/Gold"/&gt;.</desc>

But each faction has its own requirement, and if it's not met, that faction won’t come.<br/><br/>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern.jpg"/&gt;Each faction also has certain preferences in terms of food, drink, music and ambiance. If these requirements are met, the faction will be more likely to arrive in numbers.<br/><br/>The more your menu reflects your patrons' tastes, the more likely your items will sell.</desc>

Besides attracting customers, these stars also come with special rewards.<br/><br/>&lt;img src="ui/tuto/tavern_infiltration.jpg"/&gt;You can send employees to infiltrate rival Taverns. The effects of an infiltration mission depend on the infiltrator’s profession, and its odds of success depend on their Profession level, the Prestige &lt;img src="icon/TavernPrestige"/&gt; of the targeted Tavern, and how many days the mission lasts.</desc>

                    <text>You will always be welcome here, but as you just won the hardest fight we can offer, I'm afraid we are now unworthy of your prowess.</text>
